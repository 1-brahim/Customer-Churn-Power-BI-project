# Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
In this project, I built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to analyze customer churn data.  
The dataset contained information on customer demographics, account length, payment methods, contract types, churn labels, and churn reasons.  

The dashboard provides insights into:  
- **Overall churn rate (26.86%)**  
- **Churn by reasons** (e.g., competitor offers, dissatisfaction, pricing issues)  
- **Churn by contract type** (Month-to-Month customers churned the most)  
- **Impact of unlimited data plans on churn**  
- **Churn across demographics** (age, gender, state)  
- **Customer distribution by payment methods**

## What I Did  
- Cleaned and structured the dataset to make it usable in Power BI.  
- Designed multiple visuals (bar charts, line graphs, maps, pie charts) to break down churn by category, customer demographics, and service features.  
- Connected relationships across tables to enable filtering and drill-down analysis.  
- Created KPIs such as churn rate, total customers, and churn percentage by category.  
- Experimented with slicers and filters to allow interactive exploration of churn drivers.

## What I Learned  

### Technical Skills  
- How to use Power BI more effectively for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.  
- Building dashboards that combine categorical and numerical insights.  
- Using Power BI’s DAX functions for calculated measures like churn rate.  

### Analytical Skills  
- Noticing patterns in churn: month-to-month contracts and unlimited data plans had significantly higher churn.  
- Understanding how different customer attributes (e.g., age, payment method, dissatisfaction reasons) affect retention.  

### Critical Reflection  
At first, I was mainly focused on **turning raw data into charts and graphs**. The dashboard looked fine, but when I tried to explain my analysis, I realized I had **no clear question or business objective** guiding me.  

This taught me an important lesson:  
> **Visualization is not enough. Data analysis must answer “why” and “so what?”**  

Now I understand the importance of **framing my analysis around business questions** (e.g., *Which customers are most at risk of churn?* or *Which contract types reduce churn?*).
